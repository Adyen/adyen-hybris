/**
 * <h3>What counts as a subscription product</h3>
 * <p>Not this class's decision. It lives in {@link SubscriptionProductRule} and nowhere else, so it can
 * be replaced by replacing that one bean — and, more to the point, so that this class and
 * {@code SubscriptionPaymentRequestDecorator} cannot drift apart. The decorator asks the same rule before
 * the shopper is charged, to decide whether the payment has to leave a reusable token behind; if the two
 * disagreed, an order would be tokenized with nothing to activate or activated with nothing to charge.</p>
 *
 * <p>What this class owns is the answer to a rule that <em>cannot</em> answer, and it is the opposite of
 * the decorator's. A {@link SubscriptionProductUndecidableException} means a resolver failed rather than
 * said no, so the order may well be a subscription order — and this runs after the money has moved, where
 * refusing to answer must not turn into a failed checkout. It is therefore journalled like any other
 * activation failure and left to the retry job, rather than downgraded to "ordinary order". Downgrading is
 * what used to happen, and it was the one path that produced a paid order with no journal row at all:
 * nothing was attempted, so nothing was recorded, so nothing was ever retried.</p>
 *
 * <p>Such a row is not left to rot. When a later attempt does get an answer and the answer is "no
 * subscription product here", the row is closed as {@code NOT_APPLICABLE} rather than left {@code FAILED},
 * because the retry job abandons a stale {@code FAILED} into a dead letter announcing that a shopper was
 * charged for a subscription — which for an ordinary order that met one resolver blip would be false. Note
 * that {@code productCode == null} alone does <em>not</em> identify the undecidable case: a connector that
 * is not configured, or a precondition failure, reaches the journal the same way. The {@code lastError} is
 * what tells them apart, and only until a terminal outcome rewrites it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>One subscription per order</h3>
 * <p>The service is idempotent on {@code (order, platform)} and keys the remote call on the order code,
 * so a second activation for the same order returns the first reference rather than creating anything.
 * That also makes this safe to call more than once for the same order, which matters because a partial
 * payment produces one Adyen notification per leg. It does mean an order carrying several subscription
 * products activates only the first; that is logged rather than hidden.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Which store's credentials get used</h3>
 * <p>Everything that can reach a connector runs inside a session-local view with the order's own base
 * site activated, because the connectors' configuration services read their credentials from
 * {@code baseStoreService.getCurrentBaseStore()}. The callers of this class have no such context to
 * offer: an Adyen notification arrives on a bare worker thread and the retry job on a cron thread, and
 * without this both would read no configuration at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>The resolved store is then checked against the order's, and activation is refused outright when
 * they differ. That check is not defensive padding — a base site listing several stores resolves to its
 * first one, so a mismatch means the connector would be about to charge a different merchant account
 * than the one the shopper was quoted.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Failure handling</h3>
 * <p>Nothing escapes. Every caller is on a payment or checkout path where the money has already moved, so
 * a billing platform being down must not turn into a failed checkout or a rejected webhook. What has
 * changed is that a swallowed failure is no longer a lost one: every attempt is journalled as a
 * {@code BillingActivationAttempt}, transient failures are given a due date for the retry job, and
 * anything terminal or out of retries lands in the dead letter where an operator can find it.</p>
