 * What a shopper is told about one subscription, and whether they are offered a way to stop it.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately not the normalized platform status. That vocabulary answers "what does the platform say",
 * which is a different question from "what should this person read": a subscription the shopper has already
 * stopped is still {@code ACTIVE} on both platforms and stays that way until the term ends, and one that has
 * never been confirmed by any platform read is {@code PENDING} whether it is about to start or was created
 * a second ago. Collapsing those into the platform's words would produce a page that is accurate and
 * useless.</p>
 *
 * <p>Whether a date is shown is not part of the state. Every state that can carry one may also be missing
 * it — the period end is only known after the first reconciliation — so the date travels separately on
 * {@link SubscriptionEntryData} and the wording is chosen from its presence. Encoding "with date" and
 * "without date" as separate states would double this enum to say the same thing twice.</p>
