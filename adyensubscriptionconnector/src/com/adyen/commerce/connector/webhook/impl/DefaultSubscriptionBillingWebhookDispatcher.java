/**
 * Verifies and deduplicates an inbound webhook, resolves the subscriptions it concerns and then reads
 * each subscription's current authoritative state from the billing platform.
 *
 * <p>The webhook is deliberately never projected directly onto a local status. A payment failure is a
 * transaction fact, an invoice past-due event is an invoice fact, and even a subscription-created event
 * can describe a future-dated subscription. The event therefore says only "this resource may have
 * changed"; {@link SubscriptionReconciliationService} decides the resulting local state from a live
 * platform snapshot.</p>
 *
 * <p>Delivery ordering is not a state rule. An old cancellation arriving after a reactivation still
 * triggers a read of the current subscription, which converges to the reactivated state. The platform
 * event id remains the deduplication key, while {@code BillingWebhookEventApplication} records the
 * independent result for every subscription behind a multi-subscription invoice.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Failure, retry and the dead letter</h3>
 * <p>The retries on this path are the platform's, not ours: a delivery that fails is answered with an
 * error and the platform sends it again. This class decides only how long that is allowed to go on, and
 * it asks {@link com.adyen.commerce.connector.retry.BillingRetryPolicy} — the same policy the outbound
 * activation path uses, so the two cannot drift on what counts as worth retrying.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two things end it. A terminal failure ends it at once, because a delivery that will fail the same
 * way on replay gains nothing from being replayed. Otherwise the attempt count does, once it passes the
 * policy's cut-off. Either way the delivery is marked {@code DEAD_LETTER} — a terminal outcome, so a
 * later redelivery is dropped against it — and, crucially, the caller is <em>not</em> told it failed.
 * Answering with an error would keep a platform that has been told nothing is wrong redelivering into a
 * row that now discards it, which is a busy way of losing the event twice over.</p>
 *
 * <p>The unknown subscription ends the same way for the same reason. A subscription event naming a local
 * reference that does not exist yet is worth waiting for, because the create/webhook race is real and
 * short. A subscription created straight in the platform's own panel, or one whose local activation was
 * itself given up on, has no reference coming and the wait would never end. The same policy therefore
 * bounds it, and what is left afterwards is recorded as skipped rather than failed: by then the honest
 * reading is not "we could not apply this" but "this subscription is not ours".</p>
