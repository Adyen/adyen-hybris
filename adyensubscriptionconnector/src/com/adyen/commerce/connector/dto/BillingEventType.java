/**
 * Normalized inbound billing event types. Each connector maps its platform's webhook
 * vocabulary onto this enum in {@code parseWebhook}.
 *
 * <p>This is the union of the supported platforms' vocabularies rather than their intersection, plus
 * {@link #PAYMENT_METHOD_UPDATED}, which no parser emits yet and which is here for the connector that
 * will. Four values are reachable only from Chargebee. That asymmetry is deliberate: the platforms do not
 * cut the lifecycle in the same places — Recurly announces a new subscription as {@code created} and
 * reports a declined charge against the transaction, where Chargebee announces the same moment as
 * {@code subscription_activated} and reports the decline against the invoice — so a shared value would
 * have to claim an equivalence neither platform actually guarantees.</p>
 *
 * <p>Keeping both spellings costs little downstream, because no consumer reads a status off the type: the
 * dispatcher re-reads the platform for the authoritative state whatever arrives. It does, however, branch
 * on the type twice, and a new value has to be classified in both places on purpose. It treats
 * {@code UNKNOWN} as "not something we support" rather than "we could not find the subscription", and it
 * decides from {@code SUBSCRIPTION_SCOPED_TYPES} whether an event is about a subscription itself — which
 * is what makes it wait for a local reference to appear instead of skipping the delivery. Add a value
 * here and classify it there — the dispatcher's own test enumerates every value of this enum and fails
 * until the new one has been put on one list or the other, because the classification that gets forgotten
 * defaults to the harmless-looking answer and would never show up as a bug.</p>
